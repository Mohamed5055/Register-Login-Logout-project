I made this project in django after learning the basics of it
_____________________________________________________________

well this project is written in python and i used django module and just some basic html for the templates -it's even without css code because i don't know it well-
I learned the basics and then wanted to practice saving and getting data from the database and stuff like that

so anyway
to run this project django module should be installed in the machine
and then go to CMD and go to the directory where the project is downloaded by using 'cd' command -make sure you're inside the project folder itself-
-i use windows os so i'm not familiar with any other os-
and then type 'python manage.py runserver'
when the link of the local host is showed up copy and paste it in the browser
and that's it

if you went to /admin link i'm not sure if the super user i already created can be used anywhere but try to type the username 'admin' and the password '1234567890'
if you couldn't just go to cmd again and type 'python manage.py createsuperuser' then it will show to enter the username and the email and the password you choose

well if you faced another problem in that point type in cmd 'python manage.py migrate' and then try 'createsuperuser' again

and that's it i guess

i am sorry if this looks very stupid but this is the first project i uplaod so i don't know all the stuff
